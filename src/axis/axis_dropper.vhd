-- Description: An AXI-Stream synchronous FIFO with optional frame drop.
--
-- Both input and output streams are frame-based, where end-of-frame is signaled
-- by asserting the s_last_i and m_last_o signals, respectively.
--
-- The input s_drop_i may be asserted anytime during a frame, in which case the
-- entire frame is discarded, and the cnt_drop_o counter is incremented once.
-- s_drop_i only has an effect in a clock cycle where s_valid_i is asserted.
-- Note: s_drop_i is sampled even when s_ready_o is not asserted. It is an
-- out-of-band control and is NOT an AXI-Stream payload sideband, so it is not
-- required to remain stable across a stalled beat.
--
-- Frame boundaries are determined by accepted beats only (s_valid_i and
-- s_ready_o). Once a frame is being dropped, s_ready_o is held high and the
-- remaining beats of the frame are discarded until its end-of-frame beat has
-- been accepted. A drop on a stalled end-of-frame beat therefore still counts
-- once, and the stalled beat is consumed as part of the dropped frame.
--
-- Frame commit model: only complete frames are made visible to the reader.
-- The write pointer advances speculatively while a frame is being received, but
-- start_ptr (the reader's upper bound) advances only when an end-of-frame beat
-- is accepted. A dropped or partial frame simply rewinds wr_ptr to start_ptr
-- and is never observed on the output stream.
--
-- Maximum frame size is 2**G_ADDR_BITS - 1 words. A single frame that exceeds
-- this size cannot be committed (the reader can never pass start_ptr), so the
-- writer will back-pressure forever. This is by design; guard against it at the
-- system level or with a formal 'assume' on frame length during verification.
--
-- Drop counter (cnt_drop_o):
--   * Width is set by G_CNT_BITS. The default is 16 bits.
--   * Set G_CNT_BITS = 0 to remove the counter entirely; cnt_drop_o then
--     becomes a null vector and the drop mechanism still works, but no count is
--     produced.
--   * The counter free-runs and wraps on overflow (no saturation). Treat it as
--     rolling telemetry rather than an exact lifetime total.
--
-- Note: This design reads its own 'out' ports internally (s_ready_o in wr_proc
-- and cnt_drop_o in its increment). This is legal only in VHDL-2008; do not
-- "refactor" these into 'buffer' ports or you will break the VHDL-2008 contract
-- expected by the rest of the codebase.
